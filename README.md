# Web App Dashboard

My seventh project for the Treehouse Front-End Development Techdegree (see [here](https://join.teamtreehouse.com/front-end-web-development-techdegree/)).



## Tech Stack

- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org)



## Description

This was the first website where I had to use a new library without any formal instruction. Most of my work for this website went into integrating Chart.js. I created a few charts (line chart, bar chart, and donut/pie chart), including a line chart this is dynamic (dummy data changes when clicking on hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly buttons). Other features include a user search that uses the `datalist` element and custom-built toggle buttons in the settings menu.
